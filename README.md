## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

 - My first approach was to have three buttons(Daily, Weekly and Monthly) with a panel that consists of six containers(Work, Play etc) and change each value when clicking the tab by JavaScript. I was reading a forum on Discord after my completion and realised there is a specific UI design for tabs. 
 - With that tabs pattern design, there should be three tabs and each tab has its own panel that contains six cards. The focus order for the tabs is different with specific keyboard features. 

### Continued development

 - I've never used the fetch method and json data. I need to see more use cases and projects like this one.
